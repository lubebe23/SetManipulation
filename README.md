# Instructions
Create an Ordered Set
You can create a new, empty set by choosing an index (0-9). If a set doesn't already exist at that index, it will be created for you.

Delete an Ordered Set
If you no longer need a set, you can delete it by selecting an index (0-9) where the set exists.

Add Elements to a Set
Choose a set and add numbers to it. Enter positive numbers to add. When you're done, simply enter a negative number to stop.

Remove Elements from a Set
Select a set and enter the numbers you want to remove. If the number is in the set, it will be removed. Enter a negative number to stop.

Perform Set Operations
You can perform various operations like:

Intersection: Find common elements between two sets.
Union: Combine two sets (all unique elements).
Difference: Find elements in one set that aren't in another.
Exit the Program
When you're done, you can exit the program. It will clean up all resources and memory used by the sets.
